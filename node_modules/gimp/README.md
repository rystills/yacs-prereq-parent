# Gimp

## What is it ?

Gimp is a node package to communicate easily with gimp.

Note that due to package transfer, gimp will start from version 1.x for development version and 2.x for stable version.

Gimp is a good graphic software, but it's just an horror to communicate with it. Few doc, incoherents binaries and behavior differences, 
anarchic output... However, this library begins to do the job. But seriously, it's not worth it. If the project interests you, welcome to participate !

## How to use

```javascript
	var gimp = new Gimp(),
		session = gimp.session();

	session.exec('(define image (car (gimp-file-load RUN-NONINTERACTIVE "img.jpg" "img.jpg")))').then(function () {
		// ...
	});

	Promise.all([
		session.exec('(define image (car (gimp-file-load RUN-NONINTERACTIVE "d:\\\\P1100664.JPG" "d:\\\\P1100664.JPG")))'),
		session.exec('(define merged (car (gimp-image-merge-visible-layers image 1)))'),
		session.exec('(gimp-file-save RUN-NONINTERACTIVE image merged "d:\\\\P1100664_new.JPG" "d:\\\\P1100664_new.JPG")'),
	]).then(ok, nok);
```
